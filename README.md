ans.  I have faced a challenge while doing Search bar and similar movies in movie details page.
      Before I have developed the the search bar using a single api for getting movies and filtering movies, but in the app I have worked with different api's.
      And while doing similar movies in movie details page, post clicking on the movie in similar movies, it is navigating to that page but updating urls with corresponding movie id, so for that I have taken a one refresh button.
      After clicking on the movie in similar movies, we should click on refresh to get the corresponding movie details.

c. List what you would do to improve your solution if you had 4 more hours available for this task. Describe why you would do those things.
ans.  It took so many hours for not getting similar movies, I think I can improve that.
